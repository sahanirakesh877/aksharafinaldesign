 "description": "Namaskar! I am Bidhisa from Grade 5 Uranite. This year, I had the opportunity to be part of an amazing project called Kitchen Gardening at Aksharaa School, which is also our Long Term Project (LTP). It was an incredibly interesting experience that taught me so many valuable things!\n\nThis project was initiated after our engagement in vermicomposting activities on World Environment Day. It reminded us how small efforts can positively impact the environment. With the guidance of our teachers and the Root Shoot Team from the Jane Goodall Institute Nepal, we worked on growing vegetables right here at school.\n\nEvery Friday, we visited our garden to water the vegetables, remove weeds, and even harvest them. Through this experience, I learned how plants grow and why they need care. I felt deeply connected to nature and gained a newfound appreciation for the hard work of farmers.\n\nThis project also sparked my curiosity, leading me to ask questions about plants, such as how they sprout and what nutrients they need. In the classroom, I applied the knowledge I gained from working in the garden to solve math problems and deepen my understanding of science concepts.\n\nOne of my favorite moments was showcasing our work at the Root Shoot Carnival. I had the opportunity to explain our project to visitors, meet new people, and even hear from Dr. Jane Goodall. That day, I felt a sense of confidence and inspiration.\n\nKitchen gardening has taught me a deep appreciation for nature, respect for food, and an enduring sense of curiosity. I am grateful to my teachers, Aksharaa School, and the Root Shoot Team for providing me with this wonderful experience.",
